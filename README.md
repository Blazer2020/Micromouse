# Terminal Flood Fill Micromouse Maze Solver

A simple terminal-based Python simulation of the **Flood Fill algorithm** for solving a **Micromouse maze**. The script visualizes the mouse moving from start to goal by dynamically updating distances and printing the maze step-by-step.

## Features
- Terminal-based visualization
- Flood Fill path planning
- Step-by-step traversal from start to center
- Dynamic wall detection and distance updates

## Code Overview
- `floodfill()`: Updates distance values.
- `move_to_goal()`: Moves the micromouse step by step.
- `print_maze()`: Displays the maze in terminal.
